# StockMarket-Predictions

A machine learning model that makes use of Exponential Moving Averages (EMA's) to predict a future price of a stock.
However, this model can and <strong>will</strong> be improved upon in the future as it will be converted to a Long Short Term Model (LSTM, a typeof neural network) time series to maintain accuracy as the model predicts a greater number of steps into the future.
