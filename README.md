# StockMarket-Predictions

AI modelling using Exponential Moving Averages (EMA's) to predict once time step into the future on a stock's price.

While EMA is a decent prediction tactic for one step into the future,this project will change to the Long Short Term Model (LSTM) for predictions, which can predict an arbitrary number of steps into the future.
