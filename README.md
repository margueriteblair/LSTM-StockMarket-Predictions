# StockMarket-Predictions

A machine learning model that makes use of Exponential Moving Averages (EMA's) to predict a future price of a stock.
However, this model can and <strong>will</strong> be improved upon in the future as it will be converted to a Long Short Term Model (LSTM, a type of neural network) time series to maintain accuracy as the model predicts a greater number of steps into the future.

This project:
<li>Uses a Kaggle dataset to analyze the data for thousands of different stock options</li>
<li>Makes use of MatPlotLib for data vizualizations</li>
<li>Implements both Exponential Moving Averages & Simple Moving Averages to predict a future stock price</li>
<li>Compares the accuracy of both the EMA & SMA through finding the Mean Square Error (MSE)</li><br>
